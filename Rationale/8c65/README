As the Chair of Proceedings from Buenos Aires, a member of the Civics Committee, and a workshop host, I am very happy to vote yes on this action.
It is our responsibility moving forward to participate in future work streams to continue to refine this Constitution and the processes that will surround it. 

To my fellow DReps, please vote yes, and then commit yourself to participation in these new processes so that we can continue to further improve our most 
critical principle document.
