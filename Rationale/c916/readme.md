Title: Name the next hard fork HOSKY Hard Fork

Rationale: 

We're really here, in the Voltaire era. We're working together to decide the future of our chain.


To my dear friend Adam Dean, thanks for raising the first issue to a vote.

To the good doggo Hosky, thanks for all that you do for our chain adoption.


Regrettably, I must vote to decline this proposal. I think we should continue to build our collaboration muscles and find a way to communicate on the actions we wish to raise prior to raising them.
