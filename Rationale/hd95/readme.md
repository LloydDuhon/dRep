Thank you Pey for your governance action regarding K. Unfortunately, I must vote No. Changing these parameters requires a different type of governance action. 
The Constitution requires a rigorous review prior to agreeing to change network parameters.

I do appreciate your participation in governance, and sharing your experience on X as you went through the process. That alone was worth the time and effort.
